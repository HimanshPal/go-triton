Triton - Management for a Kinesis Data Pipeline 
======

Building
------

This package ships a single command: `triton`

Assuming a normal go workspace (placing this code in
`$GOROOT/src/github.com/postmates/go-triton`), you can use the Makefile:

    make

Standard go build commands of course also work.
